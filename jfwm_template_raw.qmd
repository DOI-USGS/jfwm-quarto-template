# Introduction  {.unnumbered}

Modern computing tools can allow scientists and practitioners to be more efficient, transparent, and reproducible [_doi:10.1111/2041-210X.14108; _doi:10.1111/nrm.12318].
For example, ecologists are moving away from point-and-click statistical methods to using scripting languages with code [_doi:10.1111/ecog.02493].
These changes not only make scientists more productive, but confer additional benefits.
First, using scripting allows the ready reuse of methods by their creator.
For example, scientists commonly conduct the same or similar analyses on a regular basis [such as @usfws2023].
Thus, scripting allows methods to be easily adapted and often quickly rerun with minimal formatting.
Second, sharing the code allows others to reuse methods and also recreate results when data are shared as well.

The broader scientific community has begun to increasingly see the importance of reproducible results because of a perception of a reproducibility crisis exists, across scientific fields [_doi:10.1038/533452a; _doi:10.1073/pnas.1708272114].
Thus, scientists increasingly seek to produce reproducible results, especially for computationally intensive projects [_doi:10.1126/science.1179653].
This lack reproducibility also occurs in natural resource fields [such as _doi:10.1002/jwmg.21855].
Others have provided suggestions and methods for creating reproducible results in natural resource and related fields [such as _doi:10.1111/2041-210X.14108; _doi:10.1111/ecog.02493].
Additionally, Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse (commonly known as "FAIR" by the organizers) principles exist to help scientists share and produce reproducible science [_doi:10.1016/j.molp.2018.07.005].
Likewise, professional societies and government agencies have produced guidelines for reproducible science and Table 1 of _doi:10.1111/nrm.12318 lists example organizations.

While many scientists now use scripting languages for their statistical method [for example, see Figure 2 of _doi:10.1002/etc.4800 who found that a plurality of authors in an the journal _Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry_ use R] fewer use similar tools for writing manuscripts.
However, similar tools to scripting languages for statistics (such as Python or R) exist that allow scientist to more efficiently write manuscript that are Markdown-based [_doi:10.1002/wics.1348].
These writing tools can be especially powerful when embedded with code and released, but also include other benefits.
_10.1002/wics.1348 note that Markdown-based programs such as `R Markdown` and `Quarto` offer advantages over LaTeX, Word, or HTML for the author.
These include simplicity, readability, transparency, and embedded computation.  

On a more personal note, we have observed interest in Markdown-based writing documents from our colleague and collaborators.
For example, Erickson co-leads a U.S. Geological Survey Markdown Community of Practice and all of the authors have presented tutorials to this group.
Additionally, this group includes members from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife.
We have also observed conservations about using Markdown-based writing tools in online conversations such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's "Great Lakes R Working Group".

For readers who unfamiliar with Markdown-based writings tools, we provide a brief history here.
Stanford University computer scientist Donald Knuth had trouble typesetting his mathematical equations in the late-1970s and early-1980s and this led him to create the TeX language [@knuth1984tex].
Leslie Lamport create LaTeX as a set of macros to make TeX easier to use [@lamport1985latex].
Statistics sought to easily embed statistical code with LaTeX documents.
At the time, the S-language (the language upon which R is based) was popular so the program Sweave was created to weave S with LaTeX.
While brilliant in theory, Tex, LaTeX, and Sweave all can be complicated to use and Sweave can be especially cumbersome to use.
This difficulty in use led Yihui Xie and others to create a Markdown-based program, RMarkdown [_doi:10.1201/9781138359444].
The popularity of RMarkdown led Yihui Xie and others to create a more general program that works natively with many languages rather than only R, Quarto [_doi:10.5281/zenodo.5960048].

The remaining purpose of our paper is to present our Quarto template for this journal [@erickson2023quarto].
We demonstrate useful some useful features including how to include figures, tables, and the `quarto-utils` package for automatic bibliography generation.
We also discuss how these tools may be applied to other situations.
Although our examples tend to focus on R, Quarto works with many languages.

# Methods {.unnumbered}

## Quarto workflow {.unnumbered}

* Quarto [@fig-quarto]
  - write a Markdown file with `.qmd` extensions
  - Header contains the metadata in yml format, minimal customization needed for this template
  - Template file is `jfwm_template_template.docx`
  - User simply renders file
    - Posit's RStudio likely easiest program
    - Visual Studio Code another easy editor
    - Command line a third option
  - End results is a Word `.docx` file
  - Intermediate step involves a Markdown file (`md`) but not germane to our example 
* Journal pipeline for us (Table 1)


## Useful feature {.unnumbered}

* basic Markdown
* Use LaTeX for math
* Reference
  * `.bib` file, `references.bib` with our template
  * Enter in by hand or using editor
  * easier to copy over from Google Scholar and edit
  * Or, convert DOI to bib entry using `Quarto-utils` Python package
* `Quarto-utils`
  * Mike add here
* Tables with R and Python
  * Table 1, simple and included because we wanted to show
  * Table 2 demonstrates complex headings and formatting,
  * Can use Markdown, but also easier to use `flextable` package (b/c it produces nice Word outputs)
  * Also, similar features exist with Python, but not included here
  * Imagine a standardized report, we have known statistical consultants who do this and are very efficient
* Inline code with R
  * For example typing `r
2 + 2` yields
`r 2 + 2`
  * Imagine calculating and saving some like `n_fish_year` in an R script based upon annual catch data and then having the code update your inline text every time you run the file. Useful for annual reports, but also manuscript if you update things. 
  * (currently underdevelopment with Python https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/6190) 

# Results {.unnumbered}

We have demonstrated how to use Quarto to prepare manuscript for the _Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management_.
This includes Figures (such as @fig-quarto) and Tables (Such as Table 1 and Table 2).

We have also described the co-authors random links to the upper Midwest (Table 2).
The main purpose of this sentence sentence is to be a placeholder to demonstrate the second paragraph and the related indentation. 

# Discussion {.unnumbered}

* Reproducible methods such as Quarto can help science through following principles such as FAIR
  * USGS uses FAIR principles as part of their roadmap _doi:10.3133/ofr20221043
  * Likewise, FWS uses FAIR principles [@usfws2023budget]
* Pragmatically, helps author be more efficient and avoid formatting of word documents
* Also, scientific workflow that differs by authors
  * _doi:10.5066/P9Q6SUML supported _doi:10.3996/JFWM-20-070 will often use multiples files: For example (1) format data (2) export data (3) run a long bayesian model and (4) call an R script from an R Markdown or Quarto file to produce a summary report
  * Fienen will often times run everything in Python and then write manuscript using Quarto
* Applications to other systems such as reports (key is to create template)
  * Other journals may have LaTeX templates that can readily be used
  * Easy to change reference formatting by changing style file
  * Ease of reformatting also allows for easy reformatting a resubmitting when rejected by a journal
